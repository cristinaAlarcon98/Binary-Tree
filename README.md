# Coding challenges for Kreatize
Here you can find the solution to the  proposed challenges divided in two folders with the names "FirstChallenge" and "SecondChallenge". 


To see the results of the second challenge you may follow the next steps:

## Setup Node.js,Express and Mocha

You can find the Node.js package here: https://nodejs.org/en/

To install Express write the next commands in the Terminal:

Type the next commands

$ npm install express --save
$ npm install express

To install Mocha (for the testing):

Type the next command

$ npm install --save-dev mocha

## Run the application
1. Unzip the folder "SecondChallenge" 
2. Access from the terminal to the folder with the following command cd <path>
3. Type in the terminal the following command  $node secondChallengeApp.js 
4. If everything has worked correctly you will see the next message in the Terminal: Listening on port 8080
5. Open your browser and type localhost:8080/lcm?params=20&params=15&params=5 (You can change the value of params to see different results)

## Test the application
1. Access from the terminal to the folder with the following command cd <path> (if you are not there)
2. Type in the Terminal $npm run test
